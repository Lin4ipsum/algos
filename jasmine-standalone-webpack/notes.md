##Binary Search
* finds position of target within a sorted array.
* Good for finding an item from an ordered list of items
* "The binary search algorithm begins by comparing the target value to the value of the middle element of the sorted array. If the target value is equal to the middle element's value, then the position is returned and the search is finished. If the target value is less than the middle element's value, then the search continues on the lower half of the array; or if the target value is greater than the middle element's value, then the search continues on the upper half of the array"
* works by reatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that can contain the item
* great for implementing on a sorted array
* binary search has fewer guesses than linear search
* array of 16 items would take at most 5 guesses (16-8-4-2-1)
* binary search is a logarithmic algorithm (logarithms are inverse to exponents)

Questions to consider with binary search
*Is the array sorted or does it have to be sorted?

##Asymptotic Notation
* occurs when you drop constant coefficents and less significant terms
* asymptotic notation is used to express the rate of growth of an algorithm's running time in terms of the input size n
